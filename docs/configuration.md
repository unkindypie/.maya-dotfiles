# Edit your configs

Installed files are symlinks into `home/`: editing either location changes the
same file. Reload the application afterward. Run the installer to link new files.

- **Kitty:** `~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf`; paper texture/tint in
  `~/.local/share/kitty-personal/notebook.conf`. The custom Novel theme and notebook
  texture are tracked in this repo. Its brighter cream background is
  `novel_paper` in `color-palette/palette.json`; edit that color and regenerate.
- **Wofi:** `~/.config/wofi/config` and `style.css`: paper panels, a pink search
  strip, beveled rows and crisp offset shadows. Preview with `wofi --show drun`.
  This is an optional alternative; Super+D uses the familiar Rofi launcher.
- **Rofi:** `~/.config/rofi/themes/maya-paper.rasi` keeps KooL Style 4’s layout
  with a slim classic-macOS-style frame, cat icon, right-hand rose dot,
  paper surfaces and dusty pink selections.
  Super+D preserves usage history/ranking and the apps/files/term/window tabs.
  It has no KooL or
  Wallust dependency. Applies to the main launcher; KooL’s separate menus keep
  their own themes.
- **Emoji picker (KooL):** **Super+M** opens the Rofi emoji picker.
- **Wallpaper (KooL):** press **Super+W** to open the wallpaper picker. It reads
  `~/Pictures/wallpapers/` (including subfolders), or `wallpapers/` inside your
  XDG Pictures directory if customized. Add images there to list them in the picker.
- **Lock/idle:** `~/.config/hypr/hyprlock.conf` and `hypridle.conf`. A layered 90s-style dialog,
  beveled pink title bar and blurred current wallpaper; **Super+B** or `~/.local/bin/maya-lock` locks.
  Wallpaper follows awww/swww, Waypaper, then KooL’s cache, with plain paper as
  fallback. Private wallpaper images stay outside Git. The idle warning remains
  at 9 minutes and locking at 10; display-off/suspend stay disabled. The included Lua startup
  config starts hypridle. Restart hypridle
  after changing idle settings. Weather has its own bottom-left card; battery and
  uptime share a bottom-right card. Both have pastel title strips and crisp offset shadows. The login dialog has
  a backing sheet, recessed clock display and soft pink password field. Long weather text wraps to fit. Weather
  refreshes in the background using KooL’s existing provider when present;
  otherwise wttr.in uses your approximate IP location. Cached weather stays
  available offline and is marked when stale. No location/cache data is committed.
- **SwayNC:** `~/.config/swaync/`: opaque paper cards, a cat title strip,
  rose controls and beveled borders. Reload with `swaync-client -R` and
  `swaync-client -rs`. Quick actions retain KooL integrations; locking uses Maya lock.
- **Waybar:** `~/.config/waybar/config` and `style.css`. The current keyboard
  layout with a flag (`🇺🇸 us` / `🇺🇦 ua`) appears just to the right of the date, updating directly
  from Hyprland’s layout-change events. Click the flag or press Alt+Shift to cycle layouts globally across all keyboards
  and windows; the indicator refreshes immediately
  after the switch takes effect. Per-window layout restoration is disabled.
  Non-country layouts show a globe. SwayNC suppresses KooL’s layout-change popups.
- **btop:** `~/.config/btop/btop.conf` selects the repo’s `maya-paper` theme.
  Dark ink and rose/sage/lavender graphs contrast with Kitty’s cream paper.
  CPU/GPU information stays at the top, with memory, network and processes below.
  Terminal background is preserved; process-list fading is disabled for readability.
  Theme colors are generated from the `btop` mapping in `color-palette/palette.json`.
  Restart btop after palette changes.
- **tmux:** `~/.tmux.conf`; set `@theme_mode` in `~/.tmux.theme.conf` to `light`
  or `dark`, then press Ctrl-b r. Light mode uses a compact single-row bar with rounded ends.
- **Zsh:** `~/.config/zsh/shared.zsh`. The local `~/.zshrc` loads this plus private
  `secrets.zsh` and machine-specific `local.zsh` in the same directory.
  Secrets stay outside Git with permissions 600. Recognized credential
  assignments are migrated during installation; move multiline secrets manually.
- **Maya Neovim:** `~/.config/mvim/init.lua` is a personal override, not a complete
  Neovim distribution. Install [Maya Neovim](https://github.com/unkindypie/maya-nvim/) to use it.
- **Screenshots:** Hyprshot captures into Swappy for highlighting and annotation.
  Super+S selects a region; existing Print shortcuts also open the editor.
  Nothing is saved automatically. In Swappy use Ctrl+C to copy, Ctrl+S to save,
  or Escape to discard. Requires `hyprshot` and `swappy`.
- **Hyprland:** `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.lua` is the active entry point.
  It loads installed KooL Lua modules when available, then our native Lua
  `UserConfigs/user_*.lua` overrides. Without KooL it provides basic terminal,
  close-window and workspace bindings before loading the personal settings.
  `user_startup.lua` launches Vesktop, Telegram, Chrome with its last session on
  workspace 1, and one Kitty on workspace 2. Startup runs only at login.
  Vesktop opens on workspace 3; later Kitty windows stay on the current workspace.
  Edit `user_keybinds.lua` for shortcuts, `user_window_rules.lua` for workspace
  assignments, `user_settings.lua` for input settings, and `monitors.lua` for displays.
  Personal settings retain this laptop’s monitor and keyboard choices.
  Some shortcuts require KooL scripts, Chrome, Thunar or hyprshot.
  Appearance is in `user_decorations.lua`, animation timing in `user_animations.lua`:
  uniform 3px pastel borders, fixed gradient directions, layered brown shadows,
  and no inactive dimming. Windows fade over 600 ms from 90% compositor opacity
  when unfocused to fully solid when focused. Kitty supplies an opaque background and Hyprland animates its opacity,
  so focus changes have no abrupt app-alpha switch. Unfocused windows retain
  background blur at size 8/3 passes.
  Reload with `hyprctl reload`. Shared colors still come from the palette generator.

The old `.conf` Hyprland files remain as rollback references; the Lua entry point
never sources them. Hyprlock and Hypridle still use their own `.conf` formats.
Hyprland 0.56 supports switching an existing session with `hyprctl reload full-reset`
after installing the Lua entry point. Normal edits only need `hyprctl reload`.
For rollback, remove the installed `hyprland.lua` symlink and run
`hyprctl reload full-reset` to use the preserved `hyprland.conf` again. Disable
`maya-dotfiles.path` first so link recovery does not restore the Lua entry point.
Back up custom configs before installation; the installer also backs up files it replaces.
